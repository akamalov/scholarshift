ScholarShift is a project that was started to help students ages 11-14 learn
how to basic application development works with OpenShift Online. The class covers
topics such as:

* An introduction to Cloud Native Application Development (OpenShift)
* The importance and basics of source control (GitHub)
* How to write a Hello World Program (Apache on OpenShift)

== Instructor Requirements

Here are some of the prerequisites in order to make the class successful.

.OpenShift Online Pro
As an instructor, you will need to purchase a subscription *OpenShift Online*. The cost (as of this writing) is $50 per month.

.Email Addresses for Students
Students who will participate in the class need a working email address. It is recommended
you gather the email addresses of the student prior to class. These email addresses will be used
to create accounts at *GitHub* and you will use the email addresses to add the students
as collaborators to an *OpenShift Online* project. Alternatively, you can create student email address accounts and assign
them to students.

=== Configuring OpenShift Online
You will need to log into OpenShift Online and add the students.

Browse to link:https://manage.openshift.com/[OpenShift Online's Management Page].

=== Editors
It is recommended that you have each student in the class install the link:https://atom.io/[Atom] text editor.


=== GitHub Configuration
Each student will need to create a GitHub account. If you created your students email addresses for them
it is possible for you to create GitHub accounts for them prior to the class. This is what I did, so I am not documenting
how to do it for the students at this point.


== Student Guide

This is the portion of the guide that students can follow.

.Welcome
Welcome the ScholarShift! In this class you'll learn the basics of how to write applications that run *ON THE CLOUD*!

Hopefully, your instructor has already taken you through the basics of software applications, *OpenShift Online*, and *GitHub*
so you have some idea about how software development works. Don't worry, you don't need to be an expert - that's the whole point of this class -
for you to learn by doing!


=== Deploying Your First Application

Let's get started by writing and launching our first application on the cloud, a simple website.

The first thing you'll need to do to get started is create a project in *GitHub*. *GitHub* is a website that hosts source control repositories.
You can think of source control management or link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control[version control] kind of like a library -
where everyone can write in books to build stories together. To write your book, you'll need to create a repository in GitHub
(think of that like your book).

.Creating a GitHub Repository
