ScholarShift is a project that was started to help students ages 11-14 learn
how to basic application development works with OpenShift Online. The class covers
topics such as:

* An introduction to Cloud Native Application Development (OpenShift)
* The importance and basics of source control (GitHub)
* How to write a Hello World Program (Apache on OpenShift)

== Instructor Requirements

Here are some of the prerequisites in order to make the class successful.

.OpenShift Online Pro
As an instructor, you will need to purchase a subscription *OpenShift Online*. The cost (as of this writing) is $50 per month.

.Email Addresses for Students
Students who will participate in the class need a working email address. It is recommended
you gather the email addresses of the student prior to class. These email addresses will be used
to create accounts at *GitHub* and you will use the email addresses to add the students
as collaborators to an *OpenShift Online* project. Alternatively, you can create student email address accounts and assign
them to students.

=== Configuring OpenShift Online
You will need to log into OpenShift Online and add the students.

Browse to link:https://manage.openshift.com/[OpenShift Online's Management Page].

=== Editors
It is recommended that you have each student in the class install the link:https://atom.io/[Atom] text editor.


=== GitHub Configuration
Each student will need to create a GitHub account. If you created your students email addresses for them
it is possible for you to create GitHub accounts for them prior to the class. This is what I did, so I am not documenting
how to do it for the students at this point.

=== Git Client
Each student will need to have access to a git client.
I recommend just installing the link:https://git-scm.com/downloads[Command Line Client] for your operating system.


== Student Guide
Welcome the ScholarShift! In this class you'll learn the basics of how to write applications that run *ON THE CLOUD*!

Hopefully, your instructor has helped you complete all the prerequisites of having a git client installed, having access to github and openshift.
Also, your instructor should have taken you through the basics of software applications, *OpenShift Online*, and *GitHub* so you have some idea
about how software development works. Don't worry, you don't need to be an expert - that's the whole point of this class -for you to learn by doing!


=== Deploying Your First Application

Let's get started by writing and launching our first application on the cloud, a simple website.

The first thing you'll need to do to get started is create a project in *GitHub*. *GitHub* is a website that hosts source control repositories.
You can think of source control management or link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control[version control] kind of like a library -
where everyone can write in books to build stories together. To write your book, you'll need to create a repository in GitHub
(think of that like your book).

==== Creating a Project (Repository) on GitHub
. Browse to link:http://www.github.com[GitHub] and click the *sign in* button.

. Log in using your email address and password.

. Select *Create a Project*

. You'll notice GitHub is asking you to create a new repository and it requires some information
.  Repository Name: website
.  Description: my first website
.  Make sure *Public* is selected
.  You do not need to initialize the repository with a README at this time
.  Select *Create* to create your first project (repository)

. Congratulations! You've created your first repository! You'll see that GitHub gives you several options on what to do next. We'll cover this in the next section.

==== Populating Your Repository
Earlier, we compared GitHub to a library and a repository to a book. So far, all you've done is write the title of your book (you named it website).
While this is really nice, a book without any pages or a story is a bit boring. Now we will look at adding some pages to your book. To do this, we'll
use the git client. You will need to open a terminal window on your computer and make sure you can run the git client.

. To check if git is functioning you can run it with a command line option of *version* to see if it prints out the version.
....
# git --version
git version 2.14.2
....
If this works, then you are probably good to start using your git client.

. Now, create a new directory.
....
# mkdir website
....

. Now, change directories to be inside the directory you created.
....
# cd website
....

. From here, we can begin creating
....
echo "# website" >> README.md
....

git init

git add README.md

git commit -m "first commit"

git remote add origin https://github.com/student1NBCA/website.git

git push -u origin master
